# nix-home

> **Archived** My home configuration was moved to https://github.com/bobvanderlinden/nixos-config as part of moving my system to Nix Flakes.

This is my personal configuration for [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager).

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/bobvanderlinden/nix-home
cd nix-home
ln -s $PWD ~/.config/nixpkgs
home-manager switch
```
